> A website that aims to provide users with a three-dimensional, unique and interactive ways to explore and appreciate artifacts.

### User Stories

Admin:

- As an admin, I want to have an overview of the servers and the clients that are currently connected.

- As an admin, I want to check the details of each socket instance, the details of each room, and the details of every event emitted or received by the server.

- As an admin, I want to receive feedback from users and mark them as resolved.

User:

- As an educator, I am looking for interactive exhibits that I can integrate into my lessons. It would be helpful to have virtual tours to engage my students in the subject matter.

- As an art enthusiast, I want to explore the virtual galleries of the museum to discover and appreciate various art movements and styles. I hope to find detailed information about the artists and their creative processes.

- As a historian, I am eager to delve into the virtual exhibits that showcase historical artifacts and cultural heritage. I want a fun experience where I can learn about different time periods and civilizations.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
